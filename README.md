# Arduino_basement
### Use
This circuit can tell whether you are in basement or somwhere else.

### Working principle
Idea is very clear. Diode suggest if condition of surrounding is similar to basement, wchich I hardcoced as 15 Celsius degree or less and light is not too intensive. I suggest setting break value of photoresistor by observe, and expiriment(all informations are in code so take a glympse). 

### Elements
This contraption which obviously uses Arduino board also consist of:
-RGB LED unit
-Photoresistor a.k.a light sensor
-LM35 or another decent temperature sensor
-some wireing
-couple of resistors 220 Ohm --> LED, 1k --> photoresistor 
(for photoresistor it dosen't really matter how much resistance there is)
